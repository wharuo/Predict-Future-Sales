# **Sales Forecasting Dashboard**

## **Description**
The **Sales Forecasting Dashboard** is a machine learning project designed to predict future sales based on various input parameters such as advertising spend, pricing, and time-based features. The results are presented interactively via a dashboard built using Dash.

This project showcases the power of data analysis and predictive modeling, providing business insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions about marketing, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.

---

## **Features**
- Train and evaluate a **Random Forest** predictive model for sales forecasting.
- Interactive **dashboard** for exploring predictions.
- Visualize actual vs. predicted sales trends.
- User-friendly interface for making predictions based on custom inputs.

## **How to Use**
1. Prepare a dataset in the `data/` folder. Use a CSV file with relevant fields, such as advertising spend, pricing, and sales.
2. Train the model by running `model_training.py`.
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```
3. Launch the dashboard by running `app.py`.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` to interact with the dashboard.
